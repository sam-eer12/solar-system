## Customization

You can easily customize the solar system by modifying the `planetData` array in `script.js`:

```javascript
const planetData = [
    {
        name: 'Planet Name',
        radius: 2.5,           // Planet size
        distance: 45,          // Distance from sun
        speed: 1.0,            // Orbital speed multiplier
        color: 0x6B93D6,       // Planet color (hex)
        info: 'Planet description'
    }
];
```
